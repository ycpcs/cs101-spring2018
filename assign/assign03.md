# Your Task

Your task for this assignment is to complete the following CloudCoder exercises.  We <em>strongly</em> recommend you do them in order.  The later exercises are (in general) more challenging than the earlier ones.

## Hints

Since all of the exercises (other than the first) involve loops, you will want to

1. Think about a general strategy for solving the problem, and write down an outline of your strategy
2. Consider whether a [loop recipe](../lectures/lecture06.html#loop-recipes) is appropriate
3. [Plan the loop](../lectures/lecture06.html#plan-the-iterations-of-the-loop) so that you know precisely what needs to happen on each iteration of the loop
